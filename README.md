# Advanced-Tools
This project contains a raymarching shader made in unity.<br>
If you would like to test performance you can set the parameters in the inspector under the manager and camera.<br>
During playmode you can move around the scene (Same controls as unity scene view)<br>
Once you're ready to test hit SPACE and it will start recording.<br>
After the recording it will generate a graph with the results.<br>
Once the graph is finished you can use the arrow keys to zoom in or out. Zooming in or out simply removes the first few itterations, so keep in mined that if you zoom in by 20, iteration 1 is actualy 21!<br>
## My Results and report
